Submitted by: **Enrique Rodriguez**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Summary

**ChooseYourOwnApi** is an android app that **allows the user to search up specific pokemon via name/id and displays its picture, pokedex id, and name.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üïπÔ∏è <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643514062/186/pokeball.png?1643514062" alt="Alt Text" width="25" height="25"> <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643514067/234/bulbasaur.png?1643514067" alt="Alt Text" width="25" height="25">**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **being able to search up specific pokemon via name/id**
- [x] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] Added a map that ties the type value of the pokemon to a color and changes the color of the background.
- [x] Added an autocomplete feature to the search text.

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **Poke api**.
